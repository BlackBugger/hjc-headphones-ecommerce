# HJC Ecommerce

This is an online selling platform I made for my items and I built this with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Sanity](https://sanity.io)  .

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
